# A.I Chatbot with PhoGPT and Streamlit
Welcome to my final Object-Oriented Programming assignment! This project represents my endeavor to create a conversational assistant powered by artificial intelligence. Utilizing the PhoGPT model from VinAI Research, the chatbot generates human-like responses to user inputs. With a sleek user interface built using Streamlit, interacting with the chatbot is intuitive and engaging. Join me in exploring the seamless blend of AI technology and user experience!

## Features

- Conversational interface: Engage in natural, human-like conversations with the AI.
- PhoGPT model: Powered by the PhoGPT model, a Vietnamese variant of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model.
- Interactive experience: Interact with the AI to get answers to your questions or have a chat.
